# OIBSIP_DS_1

In this task, I used the classic Iris dataset to build a classification model aimed at identifying iris species based on petal and sepal measurements. The dataset was preprocessed by encoding the species labels and splitting it into training and testing sets. I implemented a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model with k=5 to classify the species and evaluated its performance, achieving high accuracy on the test data. A classification report was generated to assess model performance in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score for each species.

To visualize model behavior, I plotted the KNN decision boundary using the first two features. Additionally, I used a pair plot to illustrate the relationships among features and the separation of species clusters within the dataset. This task provided an introduction to supervised learning for multi-class classification and enabled me to explore feature visualization techniques for better data interpretation.
